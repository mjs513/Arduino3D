/**
 * Extends the UnoTFTLCD class with 3D drawing routines.
 * The base classes UnoTFTLCD and UnoGFX have been modified to support 
 * the specific drawing routines required for 3D drawing.
 * 
 * All drawing commands accept optional list of colors for the elements.
 * If list is NULL then the foreground color is used by default. 
 *
 * Triangle lists, edge lists, colors, and edge maps are to be stored in 
 * Program memory (PROGMEM). Triangles and edges are stored as tiplets and
 * pairs of uint8_t indecies into vertex arrays. Edge maps additionally 
 * store two uint8_t indecies into the triangle array. Colors are uint16_t
 * lists. 
 * 
 * Vertex lists for drawing are to be stored in RAM. Edge sets for drawing
 * are to be store in RAM. 
 * 
 * Raw vertex sets (before geometry transformaton) are to be stored in 
 * Program memory (PROGMEM) as int8_t lists. 
 *
 * IMPORTANT: there are no variable-length stack arrays in C++, but several
 * rendering routines require scratch space to store rotated vertices
 * or to compute the colors of faces and edges. The size of these buffers
 * depends on the size of the 3D model. For efficiency, this library
 * makes no attempt to initialize "scratch space" memory buffers. The
 * arrays for storing rotated vertices, axis transformations, vertex and
 * face colors, depth, and drawing order, must be managed by the client
 * code. The client code must ensure that these buffers are large enough
 * to store intermediate calculations. 
 *
 * A variety of rendering modes are supported
 * 
 * Point clouds: Render a pixel for each vertex. 
 * Color modes:
 *      Foreground color monochrome
 *      Depth-shaded monochrome
 *      User defined colors
 *      Vertex-normal shaded
 * Line modes:
 *      Solid
 *      Dashed
 * 
 * Mesh rendering: line-drawn triangles
 *      Full transparent mode: all triangles are drawn
 *      Partial surface mode: only triangles facing the camera are drawn
 *      Either mode may be "accelerated" by caching a set of edges to
 *          draw in advance. This is limited to very simple models as
 *          stack space is usually quite limited.
 * Color modes:
 *      Foreground color monochrome
 *      Depth shaded monochrome
 *      Face-normal shaded
 *      User define colors
 * Line modes:
 *      Solid
 *      Dashed
 *
 * Outline rendering: render the border of an object as a line
 *      Computed by detecting pairs of adjacent triangles across which the
 *      Z-component of the face normal changes sign. 
 *      If an edge map is available, searching for adjacent triangles is
 *      greatly accelerated.
 *      Additionally, the outline may be cached as a set of edges for
 *      faster redraw-erasing later. 
 *      Outlines only support drawing in foreground color
 *      but do support both soli and dashed lines. 
 *
 * Solid surface rendering: filled triangles
 *      Solid foreground color
 *      User-supplied per-face color
 *      Depth-shaded monochrome face color
 *      Face-normal shaded
 * 
 * Shaded surface rendering: filled triangles with interpolated colors
 *      User-supplied per-vertex color
 *      Depth-shaded per-vertex color
 *      Vertex-normal shaded
 * 
 * Closed convex surfaces do not overlap themselves, and will draw correctly 
 * as long as only triangles facing the camera are drawn. Non-convex 
 * surfaces may overlap themselves. This can be avoided by drawing the
 * triangles from front-to-back and avoiding drawing over regions that
 * have already been painted. This requires that a draw_order be supplied
 * to the rendering function.
